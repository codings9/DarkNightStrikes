Usage, you can download the quick DarkNightStrikeVideo.mp4 video to see how it works.

But basically, you download the .exe
Click on it.
Type you Ticker Symbol.
And hit D for your Strike price, and that's it.

Works on Windows 10, and tested on Windows 10 x64 only.
Calculates Strike Price based on @iamMarkMonroe's strike technique.

The Strike Price is based on Mark Monroe's https://www.instagram.com/iammarkmonroe/
"LEAP" trading style.
And if one, want's to be safe or conservative they can round down
the strike price to reduce risks.
Or us this instead: https://github.com/codings9/BlackPantherSafeStrike
which uses the 20% corretion versus the 10% correction.
